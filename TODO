TODO
====

* Generic code to load DBCs
* Implement class Log with masks for message types
* Check why ServiceManager restarts services only once after they crashed

KNOWN ISSUES
============

* When creating a new char, client sometimes displays list before the new char is actually created, and it is not displayed (reconnecting fixes the issue) -> doesn't seem to be caused by async execution of the transaction
